Testing
My name is Tara McClellan and I am in the IT department.  I have been in IT for the past 25 years and have worked in some fun industries such as heavy equipment, insurance, education and veterinary supply.  I am excited and looking forward to being a part of the WPS team. 
My family and I live in Meridian and we love to camp, do Dutch oven cooking, and ride our ATVs in the mountains and on the sand.  I love to work out and do all kinds of exercise and I love learning about health and how to stay healthy.
